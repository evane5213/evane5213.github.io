title: "Evan Espina's Second Weekly Reflection"

This is my third week of school. This week I came across many challenges im computer science with the website I am typing on right now.
In the beginning stages of this website it was going smoothly until I was almost complete. I then had many issues arise like my post won't 
up and my blog site would not launch. Many of these issues were resolved throughout the week with the help of Mr.Allatta. 
To make sure I had the website done I spend extra time in Mr. Allatta's class trying to get it fixed. Finally on Wednesday this week I 
stayed after schoo and restarted which fixed my website and this was the best thing that happened to me all week. This is what happened 
this week and all the ups and downs I had but, in the end this website is finished and I am able to post my reflection every week.
