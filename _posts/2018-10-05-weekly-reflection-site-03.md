  This week I learned alot of new things and many challenges I faced this week. First of all, I learned about WeScheme in class and discussed about what you can do with it and the purposes it has while coding in HTML and CSS. THe next day I learned about connnecting representations, I had alot of issues trying to represent a schedule multiple ways. I learned more about styling my github page, like changing the color of something. After that we learned about HTML structure and tried labeling all the tags in that peice of code. The most challenging part of that day was when he called on me to come up and explain what that tag is and tell the rest of the class what it does.On THursday we were given the task to complete a circle connection worksheet. THe hardest part of that day was presenting to the class and talking in front of all of my fellow classmates. Overall, this week was great.
