This week the main objective were making functions and contracts. Also, using our peers as resources to help each other. On Moday, we learned more about functions and breaking them down into contracts and circles. Also, on Monday we went into defining functions and using them to design complex shapes. On Tuesday we connected representations to contracts and we created contracts as a class and indiviually. I learned that the defintion of the function is like the name of the function. Also, the fact that the stuff that makes the function is known as domain and the end result is the range. On Thursday we created a table and sorted the data we had into different categories/types of data such as number, string, and image. Also, we learned how to use bitmap/url to produce images for our screenshot. We used put-image which relates to our lesson from last week, which helped layer the images creating the complex image I wanted to make.We also learned today that a contract is a agreement between the domain and the function/ a contract is a setup. This is what I learned this week.
