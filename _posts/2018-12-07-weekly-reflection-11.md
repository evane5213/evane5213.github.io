I used many different shapes to make my flag. I used stars, rectangles, boxes, and circles to create it. I also learned that 2 circles that overlap make a cresant. I took the official measurments and ratio to make my flag. I had to make a precise outline of the flag using straight edges and such. My flag used many different shapes to make it what it is. Some questions that I have right now are how do I get the exact colora. Also, I want to know what are the units using the computer program. I also had a challenge figuring out the exact size to make the circles and how far over it should overlap. This is some question I have on this project and a summary of what I used and what I have done.
