  This week was only a two days of class becuase this week for THursday and Friday I am going to a overnight trip with most of the freshmen. We still did not start our flag project due to the fact we need to learn how to do the functions first before we move on to anything else. On Monday we continued with pair programming and cotinued to learn new functions thoughout the period. On Tuesday, we contiued to work on our skills to start the flag project and today Mr. Allatta turned this skill base project into a assessment which will be graded and that we had to complete as many problems as possible. I had a issue with the last problem and before I could figure it out the period ended and so next time, I will try to figure out that problem. But, for now that is what I learned and did this week.
