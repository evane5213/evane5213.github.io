This is Evan Espina, this is my fist post which is about my second week of school. I learned alot so far such as which classes I am going to. My first empression of the computer science class is that it is going to help me start my coding career. I like how this webpage/blog helps us with college applications and job applications showing what we learned.
Also, I figured out how to create this webpage/ blog I am typing on right now. I have made alot of new friends. I learned alot of things like domain and range in math. My biggest challenge so far is getting this website to work. This is what I have learned so far. I feel that the rest of the year will be great.
