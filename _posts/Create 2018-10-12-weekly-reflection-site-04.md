  This week I learned many new things from this week's lessons. On Tuesday we learned many different defintions for making shapes in WeScheme. We were able to use these new defintions to make our flags later on in the month. On Thursday we were able to make many connections to the last class because we did pair programming. In pair programming, we worked with a partner to code problems and figure out how to use these problems to our advantage which got my partner and I very far once we figured how to use the problem to our advantage.
  
 I learned how to make many different shapes which will help me out when creating the flag in WeScheme. All the practice we did with WeScheme shapes help me countinue my learning and how to create overlays and such functions to be able to countinue in the flag project.
