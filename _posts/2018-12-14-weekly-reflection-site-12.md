This week I was working my my flag project. This week I completed the collage of my flag and continued on to computers. I had many challeneges at first. I made a scrap flag and figured out the sizes of my flag in this test program. Then I moved on the make a final draft by defining functions. At this point I had many questions like what do I define it as, how do I use the defined names to work with put image. What are the coordinates I should put for the overlay for the stripes. I had many questions that I had to overcome by trying over and over again. I also had a challenge getting the stripes to the right spots to make the flag look seamless. This is what I did this week and how I had to overcome many challenges and had many questions when first starting out this program.
