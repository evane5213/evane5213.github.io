This week I took the computer science midterm and learned alot about myself and what I need to work on. I want to talk about question #7 which is about which function application matches the following contract. First I looked at the contract to see what the contract was and noticed it was something I have done before in class. So, I recalled what we had done and matched the function by looking at the parts of the contract like the domain. It stated String number string number which means it has a string then a number after meaking it easy to match because only one was like that. The correct answer was B becuase it followed the way fo the contract. Based on the analysis sheet it states a total of 85.8 percent choose that answer which is correct. The most choosen answer is the answer which is correct which follows the conract and the question asked. This is what we did this week, which is taking the test and going over it reviewing the questions to improve on our skills.
