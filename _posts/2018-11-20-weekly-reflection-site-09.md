This week was a short week with only one day of learning. On this day we cotinued our screenshot projects. As you can see above we have combined many things we learned to create this image. Some of the previous knowledge we used are put-image, bitmap/url, and rotation plus scale. These are the things we learned before and implamented into this image. This is what I have learned this week.
