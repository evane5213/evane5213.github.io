## Flag of Malaysia

## Describe your program

I designed this flag for Malaysia.
I expect either a 3 or a 4 because I tried using variables and scaling and making the flag as close as possible to the real flag. i tried my best to sclae the flag but I was not able to complete this task fully due to the fact my canton was made using the base layer.

## Current output

## Describe your process.

First I started out by making a collage of the flag I had to make. Then I moved on to making the program, first I made a scrap flag that had all the sizes and the layout of the flag planned out making it easier to define the variable and decide on sizes for the stripes. I had to create a flag base large enough to hold 14 stripes evenly accounting for the hieght of the flag. This is the process I went through to make the flag the way it is now.


## Explain your code.

-   Choose a significant part of your program (15 lines max) and paste it below. Do not insert your entire program here. _then delete this instruction_
-   Explain each argument in the code section. _then delete this instruction_
-   Tell us how it functions independently and within the whole program _then delete this instruction_

```
(define base (rectangle 500 280 "solid" "blue"))
(define shortred (rectangle 280 stripe-height "solid" "red"))
(define longred (rectangle 1000 stripe-height "solid" "red"))
(define shortwhite (rectangle 280 stripe-height "solid" "white"))
(define longwhite (rectangle 1000 stripe-height "solid" "white"))
(define bluecircle (circle 40 "solid" "blue"))
(define goldcircle (circle 40 "solid" "gold"))
(define goldstar (radial-star 14 15 40 "solid" "gold"))
```

* * *

-   Explain the code you posted by telling us about each argument.
-   Then tell us how your code section fits into the whole.
