## Flag of Malaysia

## Describe your program

I designed this flag for Malaysia.
I expect either a 3 or a 4 because I tried using variables and scaling and making the flag as close as possible to the real flag. i tried my best to sclae the flag but I was not able to complete this task fully due to the fact my canton was made using the base layer.
