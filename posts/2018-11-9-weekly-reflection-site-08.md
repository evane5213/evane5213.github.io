This week the main objective was making fast functions and mastery at it. We used pair programming and coninued on how to make more complex functions. On Moday, I learned how to make fast functions and change out certain values for place holders so that I can change out the values with any other value. On Tuesday we had no school but at home I used WeScheme to get a little more practice so that I am able to do simple functions quickly. I learned that place holders are holding a place so that you are able to put that value related to that spot and can be any value as long it relates to that spot. Also, the fact that the stuff that makes the function is known as domain and the end result is the range which is the purpose of a contract. On Thursday we created a table and sorted the data we had into different categories/types of data such as type, value,  learned how to use bitmap/url to produce images for our screenshot. We used put-image which relates to our lesson from last week, which helped layer the images creating the complex image I wanted to make.We also learned today that a contract is a agreement between thdomain and the function/ a contract is a setup. This is what I learned this week.
